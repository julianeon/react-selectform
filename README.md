# About

I did this project to have a good model reference for a select form implementation in React. It works for that, but it's also a fun little app too.

# Files

See SelectForm.jsx (ignore the App.css file) for a good clear Select Form example. This is basically FlavorForm from the React docs pages, plus the logic to change the content on submit - in this case, a state boolean variable, submitted, that gets flipped and displays one div or another depending on whether it's true or false.

See the CSS file for the typewriter effect, and to change the background image of Mr. Loaf.
